**Total \# of hours worked this week: 9.75**

## What you accomplished (or attempted) this week:

Most week of this week I worked on my midterm presentation on my so-far progress of my project. I finished working on completing all my graphs for question 1, as well as giving all these their proper styling, cleaning, and coloring. In addition, following the general rubric, I created a presentation of around 20 slides that talked about my project's background, data preparation and creation process, the question I answered currently, and finally what other question I want to answer regarding my dataset.

## Any setbacks/roadblocks you experienced:

I didn't really have any significant setback in my coding or work regarding the presentation. I had a few issues on planning out my presentation styling and use of images, but this really just gave me a better idea on how I would plan this out for the future board and blog of my project, as it most likely will follow the same stlying. 

## What you plan to work on next:

For the next week I plan to start working on my code for question 2, which regards word frequency and speech patterns. I will be creating visualization for all of my data's word frequencies and parts of speech, as well as performing TF-IDF on the dataset to understand which words are unique to specific Baki series.

## Are you on track? If not, how will you get back on track?

I am on track regarding my project, but I know I might have a bit of trouble with TF-IDF, so I will have to schedule time to work on that portion of my coding specifically.
