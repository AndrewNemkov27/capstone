# Introduction

Language is often considered a significant barrier in the study and understanding of global cultures. Two people from different countries often struggle to bond due to a lack of communication. This barrier is especially difficult to breach when comparing the English and Japanese languages. Both the United States and Japan are economic and democratic leaders globally, yet the major linguistic differences between the two types of speech divide both regions more than the vast Pacific Ocean. 

The sharing of literature has contributed significantly to cultural intertwining. In particular, Japanese manga has helped to connect both global cultures as a mirror of artistic and compositional expression. This project seeks to analyze the language use in manga by extracting Japanese words with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software and performing linguistic analysis. In more detail, the analysis will delve in word frequency and type of character usage in the work as well as assess OCR performance for future improvements and project development. As a result, the process aims to provide insights into how language is used in manga for story progression and character development.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of image panels from three series of the manga Grappler Baki, specifically from "Hanma Baki", "Baki Dou 2", and "Baki Rahen". These images were obtained from the DL-Raw.ac site in the JPG format and amount to a total of around 4000 images spread between the three series. The quality and size of each image varies, but most are around 3500 pixels wide and 2160 pixels in height with resolution of around 144 ppi. 

A key aspect of this project involves analysis of Japanese words or phrase and for this reason additional background information is required for the reader. The Japanese writing system consists of logographic kanji symbols and a pair of kana. These kana consits of hiragana, used for native Japanese words and grammer, and katakana, which is used primarity for foreign words and names. Both hiragana and katakana each contain 46 basic characters while kanji consists of over 50,000 characters. Considering this, Japanese school students are required to learn the 2,136 most common of these kanji characters after finishing college. As a result, most of the word phrases extracted from the manga will consist of a combination of these three types of characters.

From this background informtion, a total of 11 varibles will be used for data analysis. These variables vary from information on words extracted with the OCR process, image information, OCR characteristics, Japanese character information, and others. Further details are shown below:

* **word_JAP**: specific Japanese word of manga image
* **word_US**: English translation of Japanese word word_JAP
* **word_POS**: grammatical classification of word_JAP
* **img_title**: manga image's file title containing word_JAP 
* **img_series**: manga image's specific Baki series containing word_JAP
* **length**: length in characters of extracted word_JAP
* **confidence**: OCR confidence score for extracted Japanese phrase containing word_JAP (formatted as a percent)
* **word_freq**: frequency of word_JAP across all raw data's images
* **hiragana_ratio**: the portion of hiragana characters in the word phrase which includes word_JAP (formatted as percent)
* **katakana_ratio**: the portion of katakana characters in the word phrase which includes word_JAP (formatted as percent)
* **kanji_ratio**: the portion of kanji characters in the word phrase which includes word_JAP (formatted as percent)

# Data Acquisition and Processing

The JPG images for this project was downloaded through a publicly accessible website dl-raw.ac, which provided these pages for free usage. The pages used in this analysis will be used for non-commercial purposes only, all source citation will be provided, and the data will not be redistributed.

The JPG images will be run through a python OCR program, which would take each image and collect the words and phrases from the images into textual format. Specifically, this process will involve using PaddleOCR, a popular python OCR library, as well as Fugashi, a python library developed for the purpose of performing tasks on Japanese text such as cleaning. To increase accuracy and word recognition from each image, the Paddle OCR parameters will be adjusted accordingly to detect smaller text, improve the model's ability to detect text regions, increase batch size for more character recognition, and others.

After an image's phrases or general unstructured words are extracted with the methods above, this text will be tokenized and separated into grammatical words using the Fugashi library. In addition, before actual dataset creation, further metadata on these words will be extracted or calculated with basic python code. 

When considering the process for data of a single word, the following will be calculated below:

* Firstly, the Fugashi library will either translate the Japanese word into English with its lookup function or by using a imported python dictionary library such as SudachiPy. 
* Secondly, this library will take the Japanese word and identify its type of grammer classification such as noun; verb; or adjective; or other.
* Additionally, the number of characters in the specific Japanese word will be counted, the word's frequency across all images will be counted, and the proportion of hiragana; katakana; and kanji in the specific phrase containing this word will be calculated. 

These steps, as well as further collection of other data, will be gathered and transfered into a single row of a CSV file called BakiWord.csv. Each row will represent 11 points of information on a single extracted Japanese word. The overall CSV dataset will be a collection of many of these words gathered from the raw JPG images of the manga.

# Research Questions and Methodology

Before research questions could be effectively answered, proper data cleaning will be performed to simplify the process of dataset analysis. For example, visualizations of total words per series and the total POS per series will help in understanding the structure of the dataset. In addition, the amount of NaN or Null values will be gathered and this number will reflect how to deal with the data's missing information.

1. How does the OCR confidence score relate to word complexity, and what does this reveal about limitations in manga text extraction?

The variables used for this question will be **confidence**, **length**, **hiragana_ratio**, **katakana_ratio**, and **kanji_ratio**.

The term word complexity will be defined by the length of the word and the specific character composition of the word. In general terms, a longer word based on character length is more complex and a word that includes more kanji characters compared to kana characters in the whole word is also considered complex.

To understand the relationship between OCR confidence and word complexity, the correlations between OCR confidence, word length, and character type distribution will be measured. The most effective visualization for this analysis will be the scatter plot, box plot, and heat map.

* The scatter plot will visualize the relationship between OCR confidence and word length to see if longer words have a lower OCR confidence. If the result is a downward trend then the OCR model performs worse on longer character words. 
* The box plot will visualize the correlation between Japanese character category and OCR confidence score to compare how confidence connects with different types of Japanese words. From the graph, if the kanji heavy words have significantly lower OCR confience compared to hiragana or katakana heavy words, then it will show that OCR struggles with logographic Japanese characters. 
* The heatmap will show the correlations between the variables of confidence, word length, and the three Japanese character types through a color-based grip pattern. This will help to identify the factors that most impact OCR confidence. If confidence has a negative correlation with word length, then longer words reduce OCR accuracy. Also, if confidence has a negative correlation with a word's kanji ratio, the OCR also struggles with kanji heavy words.

2. How do word frequency and speech patterns vary across different Baki series, and what does this reveal about narrative themes?

The variables used for this question will be **word_JAP**, **word_POS**, **word_freq**, and **img_series**.

This analysis will delve into the three Baki series used in the image data. Understanding word frequency between series and types of words between series will provide insights into how words can be used to contribute to story telling, and how specific types of words bend or turn a story into a specific direction. 

The most effective types of visualizations for this analysis will be normal and stacked bar charts for analysis between series, as well as a TF-IDF analysis.

* The word frequency distribution will be shown by a ordinary bar chart, visualizing the most and least common words across all three Baki series, to allow for direct comparision of language patterns between the three. If the graph shows that certain words are used significantly more often in one series compared to the others, then this will indicate that the focus of the author has shifted on this series compared to the others.
* The stacked bar graph will be used to understand the parts of speech distributio0n, to compare the proportion of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other types in each series. If the graph shows that one series includes significantly more verbs than the others then it will indicate that this series contains more action schenes and is less philosophical compared to the other series.
* The analysis using the term frequency and inverse document frequency will provide insights into word that are unique to each series, as well as filtering common words. This will help to highlight the key themes of each series, revealing the change or shift in theme from one series to another.

3. How does the language in Baki reflect key themes of strength, violence, and philosophy across different series?

The variables used for this question will be **word_JAP**, **word_US**, **word_freq**, **word_POS**, and **img_series**.

The study  of key themes across the various of Baki series will follow a similar, yet also different analysis path compared to question 2. It will focus on identifying thematic language patterns in Grappler Baki by examining the frequency of words that relate to ideas of strength, violence, and philosophy in the series. This approach will help to understand the unique storytelling of Baki, and what sets it apart from other Japanese manga of similar style.

This question can be effectively answered with a detailed stacked bar chart.

* This visualization will exxplore the thematic word frequency across series, with the x-axis showing the three Baki manga series and the y-axis showing the total frequency of theme-related words. The bars of the graph will be divided into three segments: strength-related words, violence-related words, and philosophy-related words. Each theme segment will be color-coded with each segment providing percentge of total as additional information. This more broad analysis will allow for a visualization of how Baki's sotorytelling has evolved how how language in this manga has shifted over time. Specifically, it will offer insights into the linguistic structure and character development in the franchise.

## Some cool Quarto stuff

For your reference, here's an example of a Python code cell in Quarto,
along with a figure that gets generated, along with a caption and a label
so that it can be referred to automatically as "Figure 1" (or whatever)
in the writeup.

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
